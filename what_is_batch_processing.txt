batch processing:
    Batch processing is a method of executing a series of tasks 
    or jobs on a computer without manual intervention. It involves 
    processing large volumes of data that are collected, processed, 
    and produced as a batch. This approach is typically used for tasks that do 
    not require immediate results and can be scheduled to run during 
    off-peak hours.

Key features of batch processing:
    1. Non-interactive: Once started, batch jobs run to completion without
     user intervention. They are usually set up to execute on a scheduled basis
      or triggered by certain conditions.
    
    2. Large Volume Processing: Batch processing is well-suited for 
     handling large datasets.It can efficiently process high volumes of 
     data by dividing it into smaller chunks and executing them sequentially
      or in parallel.

    3. Efficiency: Since batch jobs can be scheduled to run during off-peak hours,
     they make efficient use of computing resources, minimizing the impact on other
      tasks and users.

    4. Delayed Results: Unlike real-time processing, batch processing produces 
    results after the entire batch has been processed. This delay is acceptable 
    for tasks that do not require immediate feedback.

When we use batch processing?

    1. Data Transformation and ETL: Extracting data from various sources, transforming 
        it to a desired format, and loading it into a target system, such as a 
        data warehouse.

    2. End-of-Day Processing: Financial institutions use batch processing for tasks like 
        calculating interest, generating statements, and updating account balances.
    
    3. Reporting: Generating reports and summaries based on large datasets, 
        often scheduled to run overnight so reports are ready by the next business day.

    4. Backup and Archiving: Regularly backing up data and archiving old records 
        for long-term storage.
    
    5. Data Analysis: Performing complex analytics on large datasets, such as trend analysis,
        data mining, and machine learning model training.
